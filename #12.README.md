# Naive Approach to Finding the Most Frequent Element in an Array using C++

## Introduction

Welcome to this blog post! In this tutorial, we'll explore a fundamental programming concept - finding the most frequent element in an array. We'll take a straightforward, naive approach using C++. No complex libraries or advanced algorithms here; just the basics.

## Why a Naive Approach?

Before diving into the code, it's essential to understand the concept of a naive approach. The term "naive" is used because this method is simple and not necessarily the most efficient. However, it's a valuable way to grasp core problem-solving principles.

## The Plan

Here's the plan for finding the most frequent element in an array:

1. Create an array with some elements.
2. Initialize variables to track the most frequent element and its count.
3. Iterate through the array, comparing each element with the rest to find its frequency.
4. Update tracking variables when you find an element with a higher count.
5. Return the most frequent element.

## The C++ Program

Let's put our plan into action with a C++ program. Below is a sample code snippet demonstrating the naive approach to finding the most frequent element in an array.

```
#include <iostream>

int findMostFrequentElement(int arr[], int size) {
    // Initialize variables to keep track of the most frequent element.
    int maxCount = 0;
    int mostFrequent = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        // Count the frequency of the current element.
        int count = 0;

        for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr[j]) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Update tracking variables if we find a more frequent element.
        if (count > maxCount) {
            maxCount = count;
            mostFrequent = arr[i];
        }
    }

    return mostFrequent; // Return the most frequent element.
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2, 6};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int mostFrequentElement = findMostFrequentElement(arr, size);

    std::cout << "The most frequent element is: " << mostFrequentElement << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
